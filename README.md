# covidAPI
Simple and easy API to check for covid information regarding an specific country

## Project Description

This is a little project that uses an API from rapidapi.com that provides information regarding covid among a total of 235 countries (https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193/). This project is used to understand the following:
  - Understand http protocols and requests (Header, Body, etc.).
  - Understand how to parse out a response from previous http request using ObjectMapper.
  - Understand ObjectMapper and what it implies (such as: Creation of classes, creating an object that uses previously defined classes, use the object to retrieve data, etc.).
  - Establish connection to MySQL DB and fetch and insert data to the table.
 
## How to Install and Run the Project
Simply export all the files. Open in your preferred IDE (i.e: IntelliJ) and execute it. Make sure that the:
X-RapidAPI-Key and X-RapidAPI-Host are the same as in the link mentioned in the Project Description section. Theoretically, it should not have changed, but if some errors arise, be aware to check those two variables.
                
## How to use the project
As mentioned, there is no specific use rather than testing and understanding protocols. Feel free to playaround with requests and modify other things.
